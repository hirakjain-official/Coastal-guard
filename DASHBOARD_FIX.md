# Dashboard Statistics Fix

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**
New users were seeing inflated statistics (showing 12 reports instead of 0) because the user dashboard was displaying **demo data** instead of actual user statistics.

## 🔧 **Root Cause**
In `app.py` lines 504-514, the user dashboard function had hardcoded "demo boost" values:

```python
# BEFORE (Buggy Code)
demo_boost = {
    'total_reports': max(total_reports, 12),  # Show at least 12 reports
    'pending_reports': max(pending_reports, 3),  # Show at least 3 pending
    'resolved_reports': max(total_reports - pending_reports, 9),  # Show at least 9 resolved
    'community_reports': 847,  # Total community reports
    'alerts_sent': 23,  # Alerts sent to user
    'response_time': '4.2 min'  # Average response time
}
```

This was designed to make the dashboard look impressive for demonstrations, but it was confusing for actual users.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**
Replaced the demo data with **actual user-specific statistics**:

```python
# AFTER (Fixed Code)
# Calculate resolved reports count
resolved_reports = conn.execute('''
    SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM reports 
    WHERE user_id = ? AND status IN ('resolved', 'closed')
''', (session['user_id'],)).fetchone()['count']

# Get community statistics (for context)
community_stats = conn.execute('''
    SELECT COUNT(*) as total_community_reports FROM reports
''').fetchone()

# Get user's alert count (if any alerts were sent for their reports)
user_alerts = conn.execute('''
    SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM alert_broadcasts ab
    JOIN reports r ON ab.report_id = r.id
    WHERE r.user_id = ?
''', (session['user_id'],)).fetchone()['count']

# Build actual user statistics
stats = {
    'total_reports': total_reports,        # Actual user's reports
    'pending_reports': pending_reports,    # Actual pending reports
    'resolved_reports': resolved_reports,  # Actual resolved reports
    'community_reports': community_stats['total_community_reports'], # All community reports
    'alerts_sent': user_alerts,           # Alerts sent for user's reports
    'response_time': '4.2 min'            # Would be calculated from real data
}
```

## 🎯 **Result**
- ✅ **New users** now see **0 reports** correctly
- ✅ **Existing users** see their actual report counts
- ✅ **Community statistics** show total reports from all users (for context)
- ✅ **Alert counts** show alerts sent specifically for the user's reports

## 📊 **Dashboard Statistics Now Show**
1. **Total Reports**: Count of reports created by the current user
2. **Pending Reports**: User's reports that are still pending review
3. **Resolved Reports**: User's reports that have been resolved/closed
4. **Community Reports**: Total reports in the system (all users)
5. **Alerts Sent**: Number of alerts sent for the user's reports
6. **Response Time**: System average (placeholder for real calculation)

## 🧪 **Sample Data Added**
Created `populate_sample_data.py` script that adds:
- ✅ 4 sample users (3 regular users + 1 admin)
- ✅ 15 diverse hazard reports across Indian coastal cities
- ✅ 3 sample alert broadcasts
- ✅ Realistic data spread across 30 days

## 🔑 **Test Credentials**
- **Users**: user1@example.com, user2@example.com, user3@example.com (password: password123)
- **Admin**: admin@coastal.gov (password: admin123), emergency@coastal.gov (password: password123)

Now when a new user signs up, they'll see **0 reports** as expected, and can create their own reports to see the statistics update accordingly.
